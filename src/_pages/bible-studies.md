There are, of course, many obscure passages requiring knowledge of some historical context, but there are enough clear truths to be understood and to live by for a lifetime. I like to use the analogy of a plane which is defined by three points. Let's call this a plane of truth. There are many more than 3 points of truth to define God's plan of salvation. If we frequently check our understanding, or interpretation, against them, we can't go wrong. And it's all about Jesus.
