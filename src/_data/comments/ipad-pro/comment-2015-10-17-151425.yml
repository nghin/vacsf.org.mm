message: "All good points. I'm certain I'd love the Pro. What I'm wrestling with
  is will I have buyer's remorse if I drop a grand on something I don't really *need*
  when I'm pretty sure they will release the cheaper iPad Air 3 in the springtime.\r\n\r\nThat
  and I'm still having a hard time convincing my wife it's a worthy purchase. Haha."
