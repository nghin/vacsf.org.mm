message: "All of my themes share common traits but all look visually different.\r\n\r\nHPSTR
  is more of a tumble-log styled theme, post after post. Skinny Bones has tile based
  archives that are more visual based instead of a dump of full posts.\r\n\r\nOn my
  [Jekyll themes page](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/) there are bullet points that describe each theme and what is unique
  about them.\r\n\r\n"
