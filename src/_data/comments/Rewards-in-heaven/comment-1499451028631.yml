message: "The idea of rewards is based on the assumption that personal merits account for something in the Kingdom of God, but we know from too many Scriptures that that is not the case at all. In Isaiah 64:6 we read that \"When we display our righteous deeds, they are nothing but filthy rags.\" Now if our righteous deeds are considered filthy rags in God's eyes, what rewards can be given? If there is anything about us that makes us qualified for heaven, it's what Christ had accomplished on the cross which is then bestowed on us as a free gift from the grace of God.\r\n\r\nJesus also gave many parables that show that the idea of rewards runs counter to the gospel; such as the parable of the vineyard workers (Matthew 20:1-16), the parable of the master and the servants (Luke 17:7-10).\r\n\r\nAnd basically rewards are based on works, and works count as nothing in God's Kingdom, it's faith in the Son of God that counts.\r\n\r\nWhy do people believe in rewards and the degrees of them? So they can brag about their own self righteousness."
