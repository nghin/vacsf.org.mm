message: "Michael, forgive me if you already know this trick BUT: once you have
  your grid finished, you can export it to your camera roll and then import that grid
  image into new drawings. You can make your drawing over the grid as you normally
  would, and when you are finished, delete the grid. When you delete an imported image,
  it just goes away without changing anything you drawn over it- so you don't have
  to erase it through your drawing."
