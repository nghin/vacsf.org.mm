message: "I randomly stumbled onto your site from a jekyll template design.  And
  being a long time user of Studio 53 Paper app this was great to see.  Especially
  since I'm like 1 of the 100'ss of people that have requested grid-paper options on
  the paper apps customer-service system.  But this is amazing, now I need to get
  a t-square as trying to just use a ruler is poop."
