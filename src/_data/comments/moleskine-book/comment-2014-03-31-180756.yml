message: "Brilliant and thorough article. Many thanks for this. I was wondering,
  do you know if image quality if Paper is enough to send off to be printed on T-shirts
  or CD covers? (Or does one have to go through this custom print process in order
  to see images of decent quality happen outside of the digital world?)"
