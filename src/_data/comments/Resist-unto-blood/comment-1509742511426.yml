message: "Hello Ama,\r\n\r\nI'm glad it's helpful to you. Most Christians believe that spiritual warfare has to do with sins or sickness or various maladies. Though there is some truth to that, the true spiritual warfare is hidden in our insecurity of our salvation. We believe with a fleeting thought in John 3:16, but deep inside we doubt very much that God loves us, maybe though He doesn't hate us, He's very disappointed in us because there are still sins in our lives. Once we lay claim to the promise of Romans 8:1 that there is now no longer any condemnation to us who are in Christ Jesus, and live by it, eat it, drink it, go to sleep with it, lean on Jesus' heart with it, we'd have won the battle and be on the path to be made whole.\r\n\r\nKeep fixing your eyes on Jesus."
