message: "I don't do any sort of architectural sketching so I'm probably not qualified
  to make a decent recommendation. I would assume precision will probably be important
  and the Adonit makes a bunch of styli I've heard are perfect for that.\r\n\r\nBut
  they're not for everyone. Some like the plastic disc tips, others hate them and
  complain about them scratching their iPads. I've never used one so I can't say either
  way.\r\n\r\nJust curious. Do you plan on using a straight edge for your renders or
  will you be doing it all freehand? I've found trying to draw straight lines using
  a ruler placed on the iPad's screen can be a huge challenge. Mostly because styli
  tip's have to be huge to trigger a touch on the iPad and that makes placing your
  lines accurately almost impossible."
