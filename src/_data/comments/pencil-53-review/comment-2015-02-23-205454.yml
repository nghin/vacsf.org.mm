message: "It's no where near as precise as a Wacom pen tablet. Drawing with a fat
  rubber nib takes practice and can be disorienting when you first attempt to draw
  on iPad. Not to mention you don't get any sort of pressure sensitivity with Pencil.\r\n\r\nThat
  said, using any stylus with an iPad does have the benefit of drawing directly on
  the surface your work is projected on. In that way it is closer to pen and paper
  than a Wacom tablet, even if the precision isn't there. Unless of course you have
  an expensive Cintiq. Then you get the best of both worlds."
