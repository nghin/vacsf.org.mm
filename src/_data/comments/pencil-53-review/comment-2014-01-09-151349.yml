message: "I really like how Pencil feels to draw with and how it glides across the
  screen compared to other styli I've used. I get the whole pressure sensitivity thing.
  It adds another layer of complexity when drawing that most will never use. Once
  you're exposed to it though it's really hard going back to a \"dumb\" stylus that
  doesn't have the feature.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see Blend continue to evolve instead
  of using the same gaussian blur effect on everything you smudge. If pencil marks
  blended more like real charcoal with a sense of texture to it that would be amazing.
  Hell I'd love for a pastel or charcoal tool to be added to compliment the pencil.
  Sure would make shading easier."
