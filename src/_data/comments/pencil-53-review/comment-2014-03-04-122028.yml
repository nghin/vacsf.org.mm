message: "The Wacom Bamboos are a pretty good all around affordable styli. I'd
  suggest getting a stylus that is fairly cheap to see how you like drawing with one.\r\n\r\nSince
  your on an iPad 2 and can't use a stylus with pressure sensitivity they all pretty
  much work the same. It really just comes down to fit, finish, durability, and how
  it feels in your hand."
