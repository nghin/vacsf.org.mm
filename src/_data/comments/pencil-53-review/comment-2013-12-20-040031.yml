message: "For what it's worth I've never noticed any serious lag drawing with my
  finger, normal styli, Bluetooth styli, or Pencil with Paper. At least not enough
  to effect how I use the app.\r\n\r\nI know Apple made changes to their screen tech
  and that screwed with how some styli function like the Pogo Connect. I use a 3rd
  gen iPad so I can't confer if Paper and Pencil lags on the Air. I suspect
  if it was an issue I would have seen mention of it from a few folks I follow on
  Twitter and Tumblr."
