message: "I'm planning on doing an in-depth review of Surface Pressure as it compares
  to the Pogo Connect (a true pressure sensitive enabled stylus), but have been waiting
  for an update to Paper that enables it for all of the tools.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime
  here are some of my quick thoughts:\r\n\r\n* Surface Pressure for the most part works
  in a more natural and true to life way than other styli in it's category. When you
  want to paint a wider stroke you use the fat side of Pencil just like you would
  with a paint brush.\r\n* In some circumstances drawing with a Pogo Connect feels
  more natural. For example the pencil tool. If you were using a real pencil you'd
  press harder to make a darker line. The same behavior occurs with a Pogo Connect,
  unlike 53's Pencil.\r\n* Learning to use Surface Pressure in a controlled and
  fluid way can take some practice. Sure it's easy to use the broadside of Pencil
  to fill in an area quickly. But if you want to create a line that varies from thin
  to thick, in an exact and smooth way you have to perform some crazy maneuvers with
  your hand by rotating Pencil's tip from side to point. Some will argue that pressing
  on the tip of a Pogo to do the same thing can be difficult, but I always found it
  pretty easy to pull off compared to Pencil.\r\n* Overall I think using Pencil
  and Surface Pressure together is a more enjoyable experience than using a Pogo Connect.
  I've gotten sick of the constant disconnects and manual restarts to get the stupid
  thing to work properly with Paper. Neither styli is perfect in all circumstances.
  At this point I wouldn't bother wasting money on a Pogo because it has some serious
  problems with newer iPad's since Apple change the display technology behind the
  screen."
