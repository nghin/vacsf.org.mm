message: "I can't say for sure since I don't have an iPad Air or the official Apple
  Smartcover.\r\n\r\nThe Walnut Pencil sticks fine to my knockoff smartcover. It has
  a magnet in it so I don't see why it wouldn't work with all smartcovers, unless
  Apple screwed with how they adhere to the screen."
