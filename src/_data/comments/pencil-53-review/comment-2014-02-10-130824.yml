message: "It's about the same as other styli... maybe slightly better. I find
  writing with Paper hard. The only way I can write something is by zooming in, which
  isn't the best if you're taking a lot of notes.\r\n\r\nI would think one of the Adonit
  pens with the plastic disc tips would be better for writing since they're more precise.
  It's hard writing with a rubber nib because you can't really see the point to place
  your marks accurately."
