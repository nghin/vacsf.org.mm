message: "Hi Paul. Yes I still experience the mistaken blends. It has gotten better
  from software updates, but I do notice it happening. I've seen others go as far
  as turning off the Blend feature in Paper's settings until they need it and then
  flipping it back on.\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much how I use it now. I do 90% of my drawing
  with a Pogo Connect (just because I like the extra sensitivity it allows) and then
  I'll connect a Pencil if I need to Blend something.\r\n\r\nThe only other suggestion
  I have is to press hard when you draw. If you press too light it won't trigger as
  an input and therefore Paper thinks it's your finger and begins blending. The delays
  you've noticed I think are from the software trying to be smart and determine if
  a stroke was made by Pencil or your finger after the fact and correcting accordingly.\r\n\r\nI've
  also noticed Pencil's tip \"dulling\" after using it for a bit. The mechanism behind
  the tip appears to lose its springiness and that could be another reason why blend
  is falsely triggered.

Hope this helps!"
