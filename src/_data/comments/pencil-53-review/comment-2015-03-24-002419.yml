message: "I've used cheap Smart Cover knockoffs and that's about it. In all the
  iPhones and iPad's I've owned I never saw a need for a screen protector... even
  with two small little ones who like throw and smash shiny things :-)\r\n\r\nAs you
  mentioned they mess with the responsiveness of rubber tipped styli. They don't look
  or feel all that great either. The screens are pretty tough and can take some abuse.
  Just don't go dropping them on asphalt and you'll be fine."
