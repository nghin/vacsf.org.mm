message: "No you're right. Up until iOS 8 and Paper 2.0, using the fat edge of
  Pencil didn't produce any different effects with the marks you made. Surface Pressure
  is indeed enabled now in Paper, just not for the pencil tool.\r\n\r\nThat's coming
  eventually. I'm not entirely sure why it wasn't turned on with the other tools.
  I can only guess that the shading behavior teased in the video wasn't up to FiftyThree's
  standards and they delayed releasing it to fine tune."
