message: "All styli \"work\" with Paper as \"dumb\" styli. Meaning they'll make a mark
  but you won't get all the extra features like pressure sensitivity with Paper.\r\n\r\nThe
  only Bluetooth styli that Paper officially supports is Pencil and the Pogo Connect.
  A note about the Pogo Connect, it's not fully supported on newer iPad's like the
  Air or Mini and they're prone to breaking, so buyer beware and all that.\r\n\r\nAny
  of the others like the Wacom Inuos and Adonit Jot Touch that have pressure sensitive
  tips don't work with Paper. If that matters to you then an app like Procreate is
  a good alternative. It supports a bunch of styli."
