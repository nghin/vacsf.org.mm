message: "Sadly you can't change the brush size. The best you can do is manipulate
  the width of the fountain pen depending on how fast you draw a stroke. Or you can
  buy a Pogo Connect stylus and that lets you vary brush size depending on the amount
  of pressure you apply. Press light get a small stroke, press hard get a thicker
  one."
