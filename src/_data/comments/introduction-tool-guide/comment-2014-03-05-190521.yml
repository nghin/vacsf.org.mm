message: "Use two fingers, and move it in a circular motion (see <http://support.fiftythree.com>).
  Not too fast and not too slow. Just stick with it and you'll eventually learn how
  to trigger it 100% of the time.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're really having problems using
  it, you can always buy a Pogo Connect if you have a 3rd/4th generation iPad. There's
  a button on the stylus that acts as an undo in Paper."
