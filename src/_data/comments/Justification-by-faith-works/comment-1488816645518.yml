  Hello Tony, your comment couldn't have come at a better time. Yesterday, a friend at
  church encouraged me to write a full commentary on James as he also came to
  the same conclusion that this book, no matter how hard people try to prove
  that it's all about God's grace, casts doubt on whatever it purports to be.
  "Works" is relative and it is based on the feeble human who tries to perform
  it with all possibly fleshly motives, and if it, or the lack thereof, can
  render my faith dead, what hope do I have?
