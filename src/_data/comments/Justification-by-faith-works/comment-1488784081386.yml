  Thank you brother Nghi, I have been wrestling with Romans 8.13 ("mortify the
  deeds of the flesh" and what it means. Your article on that topic and your
  writing above have kept me under grace, when my old man is desperately trying
  to get me to work my way into God's presence. Our God Yahweh and Yeshua bless
  you. Tony H
