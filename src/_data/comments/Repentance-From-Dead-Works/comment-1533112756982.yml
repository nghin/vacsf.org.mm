message: "Hi Chase,\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing something but I see no conflict between Hebrews 6:6 and 12:4 with the former addressing salvation while the latter discipline. Moreover, the discipline is not about punishment for sins committed--as Christ took it all on the cross--, but about training in righteousness, the opening of our eyes, the transforming of our minds, so we may grow in the grace and knowledge of our Saviour Jesus Christ (2 Peter 3:18).\r\n\r\nGalatians 5:4 may be used together to Hebrews 6:4-6 to aid in our understanding:\r\n\r\n> You who are trying to be declared righteous by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace! (Galatians 5:4)\r\n\r\nBack to Hebrews 12:4, my position as expressed throughout all my writings has always been that a Christian's life must be driven with the purpose of discovering what Christ has accomplished for them as opposed to what they will accomplish for him, there in lies my interpretation."
