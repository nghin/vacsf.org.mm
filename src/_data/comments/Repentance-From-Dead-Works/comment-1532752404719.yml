message: "Here's a shorter version of my earlier reply to your question.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the book of Hebrews is a comparison of the two ways sin is dealt with. The old way of repetitive offering of sacrifices of bulls and goats versus the new way of the once-for-all sacrifice of the Lamb of God. One way can effectively remove the guilt of sins while the other cannot. The Hebrews author uses strong language to warn the audience of the danger of relying on useless ways to deal with sins, and more importantly, of returning to the use of \"dead works\" to deal with sins after having tasted the \"new and living way\" through the body of Christ. This new way is based on faith, not works.\r\n\r\nNote that Hebrews 6:1 uses the term \"dead works\" to refer to the use of human effort to draw near to God. Sins of all forms are not works. Works are always used to describe human effort to achieve higher spirituality. Therefore Hebrews 6:4-6 must be understood in context of  all previous chapters leading to it. Those who have \"tasted the heavenly gift\" are those who have received the gift of salvation by faith, not works; their \"apostasy\" is their return to the useless offering of bull and goats as if Christ didn't die for all their sins, as if they say Christ must die again because they're still in their sins. We non-Jewish Christians may commit this apostasy when we likewise use other means to get forgiveness apart from the simple trust in Christ.\r\n\r\nThe gist of Hebrews 6:4-6, or the entire book of Hebrews for that matter, is not about the danger of sinning, but of the danger of showing contempt for Christ by relying on the useless system of salvation. Both systems, with the old based on human effort versus the new based on faith in Christ, aim to take care of the issue of sins. Which one do you trust? That's the question the Hebrews letter asks us.\r\n\r\nHebrews 6:4-6 has been misinterpreted, and hence misapplied, by overwhelming majority of handlers of Scriptures and cause a great amount of pain and frustration to their hearers."
