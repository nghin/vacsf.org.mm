message: "Some additional thought on Hebrews 12:4. Let go back a few prior verses:\r\n\r\n> Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, we must get rid of every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and run with endurance the race set out for us, keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith. (Hebrews 12:1-2)\r\n\r\nThe weight and the sin here must be understood as the sin of unbelief, the sin that prevented the Hebrews from entering the promised land, the place of true Sabbath rest for us who trust in Christ (Hebrews 3:19), and the sin of unbelief that the Holy Spirit convicted the world of when he came (John 16:8-9). This is the most fatal sin as it prevents all other sins from being forgiven (Matthew 12:31)."
