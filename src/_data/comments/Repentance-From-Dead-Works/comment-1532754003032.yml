message: "Hey Nghi!\r\n\r\nI appreciate your response. So the author is communicating the superiority of Christ and the new covenant. I definitely see that throughout the book. And so the impossibility lye in the Hebrews repentance through offering temple sacrifices as prescribed in Leviticus. I think that’s a good approach however I don’t understand how that interpretation can fit with Hebrews 12:4 where the author says you have not resisted yet unto the shedding of blood in your battle against sin. I read different commentaries on this passage and from the context they had suffered persecution and even having their goods plundered however they had still not returned to Judaism instead they were enduring well. So Can you explain how they had fallen away in 6:6 but seem to have not actually fallen away according to Hebrews 12:4?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nChase"
