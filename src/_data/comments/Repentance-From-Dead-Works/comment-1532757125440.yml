message: "Hi Chase,\r\n\r\nBoy, your asking me about Hebrews 12:4 is a tough one. It appears this verse is mostly used in the context of discipline, not salvation. I will endeavor to study it and will share with you my understanding.\r\n\r\nThere are so many parts of the Bible that I have heard, and read about, over the years since I became a Christian, but never studied in depth. However, despite the lack of thorough knowledge of Scriptures, I think I know enough foundational truths to form a basis from which I make sense of many parts of the Bible. I often liken Scriptural truth to a geometric plane, a plane of truth, which requires 3 points for its definition. So any point that falls on the plane, it's in no conflict with the other 3 points. I believe I know quite a bit more than 3 points that define the gospel truth that I have come to believe. By always checking my interpretation against these foundational points of truth, I think I can guard myself against crazy making beliefs. Chances are anything that I cannot readily understand, it must be because I fail to see its meaning from the perspective of the writer or the historical context. And it's ok, I don't need to know everything to enjoy Bible study and to share with the world the truth that sets me free.\r\n\r\nSo, stay tuned, Chase, I will study Hebrews 12:4 and will get back to you."
