message: "Looks like you found a bug in the CSS. When I converted the menu styles
  into Sass partials I must have left out a few declarations that used to display
  the menu expanded when JS is disabled. I just pushed a [quick fix to GitHub](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme/commit/c731e8cc825e22f235450968aad1d86a985bc20f)."
