message: "\"Not working\" is fairly vague so I'm just taking a stab here that your
  styles and such aren't loading properly. The number one culprit for that is due
  to not setting `site.url` properly in `_config.yml`\r\n\r\nWhen serving locally it needs
  to be either left blank or set to your localhost server (eg. `http://localhost:4000`).
  When uploading to your web server it needs match the domain you're serving from
  or else you'll experience broken links galore."
