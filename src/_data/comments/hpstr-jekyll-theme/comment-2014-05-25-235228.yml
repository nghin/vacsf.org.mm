message: "Hi! Just want to say that the theme looks great! I would really like
  to use it for a site I'm making. However, I'm running into some trouble with linking
  back to home page. I'm currently leaving the `url` field in `_config.yml` blank because
  I'm using Github Pages to host but I am unable to link back to the Home page from
  some of the other pages. Should I set the `url` field to the url of the github page?"
