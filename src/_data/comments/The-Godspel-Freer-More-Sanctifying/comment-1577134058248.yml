message: "Yes, a lovely piece from Dr Chalmers, Nghi.\r\n\r\nRe the 'service' Dr Chalmers mentions, looking up all the times Psalms speaks of 'paying of vows' a clear theme of giving thanks is evidenced, with the NT clinching it with; 'The sacrifice of praise, the fruit of our lips'.  Our service, is praise to His name in the Great Congregation."
