  Yes, "Grow in the grace ...". 2 Peter 3:18 that I memorized without a full
  understanding of it until decades later. When I first saw the topic
  "Understanding Forgiveness" at Aaron Budjen's website, I thought to myself:
  basic stuff, I knew all about it already. Little did I know it sure does help
  me "grow in the grace ..." way beyond my already held belief on the topic.
  Aaron didn't teach me anything new, but he did help me grow deeper in the
  understanding of God's forgiveness.
