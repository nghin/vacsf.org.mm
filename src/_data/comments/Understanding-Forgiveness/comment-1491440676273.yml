message: "The real issue is most Christians don't know God's grace enough to abuse it.\r\n\r\nWhen the apostle Paul says \"Everything is permissible\" in 1 Corinthians 10:23, he really unleashed God's grace. But most sermons don't expand on this part of the verse, and instead focus on the part that follows it: \"but not everything is beneficial.\" The end result is God's forgiveness is dispensed in small doses; Jesus' blood is used repeatedly to cleanse each sin, like through our confessions.\r\n\r\nThe truth is there is one confession to call Jesus Christ Lord and Savior, and there is one shedding of blood of the Son of God to forgive the sins of the whole world once for all and never to be repeated again."
