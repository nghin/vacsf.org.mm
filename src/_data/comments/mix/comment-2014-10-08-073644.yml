  clever methods!\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the Search bar atop Mix is meant to be for.
  I can't seem to be able to search for any person's name. Ideally one should even
  be able to search also for things or tags.\r\n\r\nPerhaps being a new inductee into
  the cult, 53 won't allow me to look people up, until I've proven my worth."
