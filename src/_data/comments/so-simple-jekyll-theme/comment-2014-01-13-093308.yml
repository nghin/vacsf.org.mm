message: "I'm sorry for being so ignorant but I'm not sure if I'm hosting my
  site to Github Pages... I mean I only have a single repo in github which is my site,
  then when I update my site I push all changes to github, and my site is reached
  at <http://aadm.github.io> does it mean
  that my site is hosted on Github \"Pages\" (I would answer yes if you were asking
  me whether I host my site on Github; Github \"Pages\" -- not sure what it is). Again
  sorry for being so naive...\r\n\r\nAnyway you can look at the [source for my site
  here](https://github.com/aadm/aadm.github.io)\r\n\r\nBTW
  another thing that's confusing to me is the need to put my site on the `gh-pages`
  branch as [some tutorial page](http://opentechschool.github.io/social-coding/extras/pages.html), section \"Manual Creation\")
  recommend. I have it on my `master` branch. Not sure whether I need to move it?...\r\n\r\nAnyway
  let's assume that the reason why the plugin fails is because I'm actually hosting
  on Github Pages. It should be working locally anyway, right (creating the site with
  `jekyll --serve` etc and testing it on `http://localhost:4000`)? Well it isn't. I also
  am not sure I know how to \"deploy the files in `_site`\" as you suggest."
