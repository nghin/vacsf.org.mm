message: "Thanks for the theme, it's very neat! I'm using it as a base for my site
  but I'd like to limit the size of the `page.image.feature` element to some arbitrary
  limit, say 800px, and keep it centered. By tinkering with the CSS I can do the former
  (`max-width: 800px`) but the image pushed to the left and I can't figure how to center
  it. I've tried to set margins to auto, and enclose the image in a wrapper, but none
  of that work. Any chance you could help?"
