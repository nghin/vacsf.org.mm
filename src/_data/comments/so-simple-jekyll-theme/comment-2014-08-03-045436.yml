message: "Currently no.\r\n\r\nWhen I update So Simple to support some new features
  in Jekyll 2.x I plan on using the new Octopress gem that makes creating new posts/pages
  much easier.\r\n\r\nOnce
  the [Octopress Ink gem](https://github.com/octopress/ink) is released I may investigate making the theme compatible
  with it. But for now I'm waiting to see how things shakeout and if there's a demand
  for it. "
