message: "Take a look at the [sample posts](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/tree/master/_posts/articles) in the GitHub repo for the theme. You
  set the tags for each post in their YAML Front Matter.\r\n\r\n
  \r\n\r\nAnd then on the tags
  page it groups them [like this](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/tags/). If you want a page for each tag with the related
  posts listed you'll have to use a Jekyll plugin to do that."
