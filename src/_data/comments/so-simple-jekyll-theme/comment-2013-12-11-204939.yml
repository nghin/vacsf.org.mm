message: "First of all, thanks for the lovely theme. I have a question about the
  use of Disqus. I have an account and I added the s`hortname` to my `_config.yml`. Before
  I used Jeykll on my server I tested it local and I could add an comment. Now on
  my server I can't. Do you have an idea why? I checked the shortname and I also set
  `comments: true`. thx :)"
