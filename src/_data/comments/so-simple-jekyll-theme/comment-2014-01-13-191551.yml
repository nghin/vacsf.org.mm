message: "Re-read your original comment, doesn't seem like it's a plugin issue...
  well not when you work locally. The fact that you are getting an unordered list
  tells me the Jekyll plugin is working. The problem lies with loading the scripts
  that does all the styling magic.\r\n\r\nWithout seeing that code I can't troubleshoot
  effectively. But my guess is there is a jQuery or script conflict somewhere in the
  code. If you open the web inspector on a page that doesn't load the gallery correctly,
  do you see any JavaScript errors?"
