message: "Looks like you're using Github pages then. There are two ways to host
  your site with Github, on the `master` branch if you have one repo, or as a project
  using the `gh-page` branch. For example I host all of my Jekyll themes on Github using
  the project method because I have multiple repos. GH recently redid their hosting
  documentation and [this page](http://pages.github.com/) should clear things up for you \r\n\r\nSo back to the plugin issue. You
  won't be able to use them with your current git workflow but you can build the site
  yourself and push that. The general idea is instead of committing your source Jekyll
  files and letting Github generate the site, you need to build it locally yourself
  and commit all the files in the `_site` folder instead. Here's a site that [explains it pretty
    well](http://davidensinger.com/2013/04/deploying-jekyll-to-github-pages/) and also explains how you can automate things with rake.\r\n\r\nAnd yes. The plugins
  should still work locally. I'll take a look at your repo when I get a chance to
  see if something jumps out to me."
