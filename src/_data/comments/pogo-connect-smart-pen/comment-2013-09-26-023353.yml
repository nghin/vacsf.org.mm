message: "Let me know how your fourth stylus goes. My replacement seems OK so far.
  I did have some trouble getting a battery out of it. Not sure what the deal was,
  but it was super tight and almost impossible to get out. The metal used in the pen's
  frame is fairly soft and I ended up bending part of it trying to force the battery
  out. Not the end of the world, but definitely not the most well made product.\r\n\r\nIt's
  a shame, because I really like the tip and how it handles with Paper by 53. I'd
  love to give the Jot Touch 4 a go, but it's not supported by Paper, and I don't
  use Procreate or any of the dozen other apps it works with all that much."
