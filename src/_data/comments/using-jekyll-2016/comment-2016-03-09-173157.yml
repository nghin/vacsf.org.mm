message: "I've found there isn't much to learn with Jekyll per say as there is
  with keeping up with modern web development tooling and trends.\r\n\r\nSince Jekyll
  does a good job of getting out of your way it leaves you with a blank canvas to
  do whatever you want in terms of markup, styling, scripting, etc. That's were the
  real learning takes place."
