  In your web article titled "Mortify the deeds of the flesh" are some serious
  errors which need to be addressed. The article misses the point, although it
  touched on it at some time, in one paragraph it says "who wrestles with dead
  flesh? If indeed the deeds of the flesh could be put to death, then there
  would be no longer any struggles in the lives of Christians, wouldn't there?
  And who would want to wrestle with something that is dead?" But that is
  exactly the point. Jesus put the flesh to death FOR US and this is what we
  exercise faith in, His mortification of the flesh, "this body of death" (where
  he was NOT speaking as a Christian by the way) so that we don't have to,
  because we can't, and if we try to do so he is displeased because that is the
  whole point of salvation, faith in Him having done it for us!
