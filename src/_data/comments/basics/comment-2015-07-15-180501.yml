message: "There's not much more to the process than what I included above.\r\n\r\n1. Use
  the pen tools to create the general shape and fill it in.\r\n2. Add some dots of various
  sizes around it to simulate the splatter.\r\n3. To make some blobs look more 3D add
  highlights using white or another light color with the pencil tool.\r\n4. To finish
  it off add a drop shadow with a light gray and the watercolor brush, zoom in, and
  paint quickly along the edge where you want to cast a shadow."
