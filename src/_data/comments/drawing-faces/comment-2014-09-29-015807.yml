message: "Pre-Paper version 2.0.0 I would have said yes it's worth getting a Pogo
  Connect. But now with Surface Pressure and some enhancements made to the watercolor
  brush you can pretty much do everything the Pogo allowed you to do.\r\n\r\nNot to
  mention the Pogo Connect is a big steaming pile of unreliability. When it works
  it works awesome. The other 95% of the time it constantly disconnects or stops registering
  touches and you have remove the battery to power cycle it. I've never had those
  sorts of issues with Pencil."
