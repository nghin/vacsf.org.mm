message: "I knew how to draw ok before I started but was no where near the level
  I ended up doing a Paper drawing every day for two years straight. If you look at
  my [PaperFaces gallery](http://mademistakes.com/paperfaces/) and scroll all the way to the bottom you'll see how very simply
  my early stuff was. Practice made all the difference."
