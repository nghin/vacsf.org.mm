message: "Thanks for the kind words Barry! To answer your question, yes I've thought
  about writing a book. I don't know if a printed version will ever happen but I'd
  like to do some sort of eBook or at the very least a companion guide to go along
  with my Mastering Paper series.\r\n\r\nI'm kind of partial to the web based incarnation
  of the series because it's easier for me to update as Paper continues to involve.
  Not to mention I have a bunch of gaps that I need to fill in on using Paper that
  I don't know if I'll ever get to them to make publishing a book on the subject worth
  while. If there were only more hours in the day ;-)"
