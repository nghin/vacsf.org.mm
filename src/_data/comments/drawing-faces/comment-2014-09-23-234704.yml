message: "Out of all the rubber tipped styli FiftyThree's Pencil is easily the one
  with the smallest tip... but that's not saying much. If you want something a little
  more accurate and precise I'd look into [Adonit's Jot Pro](http://www.adonit.net/jot/pro) if you're only using Paper.
  Other wise their more expensive pressure sensitive styli look quite nice, but they
  only work with Procreate and a few other apps."
