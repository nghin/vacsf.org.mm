message: "The new Pencil looks great and I really appreciate the above first look.
  As a user who also has a Pogo Connect, do you think its worth picking up? I guess
  the main features being swapped are pressure sensitivity/button undo for blur/actual
  erasing. I realize you are going to write a more in-depth review later but would
  love to see the two pens discussed."
