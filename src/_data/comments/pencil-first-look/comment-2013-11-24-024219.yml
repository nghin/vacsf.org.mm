message: "Thanks Lauren.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question, yes you need to have a
  Pencil. I'm not sure if you're seen the videos on FiftyThree's website, but how
  it works is you touch the tip of Pencil to an icon in the tool tray of Paper. After
  a few seconds it connects with it and then the extra stuff like palm rejection and
  blend.\r\n\r\nFor blend to work you need Pencil connected. When it's connected to
  Paper you can only draw with it. Using your finger or another stylus will smudge
  and blur whatever you touch."
