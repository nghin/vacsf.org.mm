## 1.  THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION  

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
*“<sup>10</sup>My aim is to know him, to experience the power of his
resurrection, ..."*
</span> (Philippians 3:10a)

Last week, we discussed the concept of *“So that I might know him,”* and how the condition for knowing God is when *“I regard them as dung.”* *“Them”* here are fleshly efforts that Paul expended to satisfy the requirements of the law, as well as praise and respect from men who were his contemporaries who also lived under the law.

We continued with the idea of *“that I might experience the power of his resurrection”* this week. One possible question here is: What does it mean to experience the power of his resurrection? What else could it be but what Adam and Eve have lost since the beginning of time, the burden of sin that they have passed on to their descendants, the separation from God as a result of their sin nature, and the many other consequences that have resulted?

God had restored to those who believe what Adam had lost through the death of Christ. But how can Paul, and all who read his letter, *“experience”* the power of Christ’s resurrection?

If we live by the precept that *“the just shall live by faith,”* we can only *“experience”* by faith, by firmly believing God’s promise of the *“power of his resurrection.”* While God may heal someone, that healing does not imply eternal life. Someone may have been delivered from some major life challenges, but they are not yet in God’s kingdom. Because eternal life and the coming of God’s kingdom will occur only *“in a moment, in the blinking of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.”*(1 Corinthians 15:52)

## 2. SHARE IN HIS SUFFERING, BE LIKE HIM IN
HIS DEATH, RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD    

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
*“ ... <sup>10b</sup>to share in his sufferings, and to be like him
in his death, <sup>11</sup>and so, somehow, to attain to the
resurrection from the dead.”*
</span> (Philippians 3:10b-11)

Using the same interpretation, we are given everything mentioned in the subtopic above simply because we are considered to have died with Christ and thus will be raised with him.

*“Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may live a new life.”* (Romans 6:4)

*“Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.”* (Romans 6:8)

## 3. NOT ALREADY PERFECTED, BUT ALREADY
LAID HOLD OF BY CHRIST

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
*“ <sup>12</sup>Not that I have already
attained this – that is, I have not already been perfected
– but I strive to lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus
also laid hold of me.”*
</span> (Philippians 3:12)

This is a mystery of faith. Like someone who has been granted US citizenship but must wait until the day they can swear allegiance to the flag. Like us, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit by the faithful promise of God, but we must wait until the last trumpet is sounded, when Christ returns.
