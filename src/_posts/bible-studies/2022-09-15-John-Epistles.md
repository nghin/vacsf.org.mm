While you should approach the Scriptures with an open mind and always expecting revelation from the Holy Spirit, you must have an orientation and know exactly where you are, just like when studying a map. You must have a frame of reference or you will not understand what you are reading.

As I survey God's Words, my frame of reference is the New Covenant, with a significant amount of foundational truths serving as anchor points.

A plane in space is defined by at least three points, so all of the points that fall on this plane agree completely. The same is true of God's Word as a plane of truth. At least the following verses define my Scriptural plane of truth in my opinion:

*"<sup>10</sup>For all who rely on doing the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not keep on doing everything written in the book of the law.”  <sup>11</sup>Now it is clear no one is justified before God by the law, because the righteous one will live by faith."* (Galatians 3:10-11)

*"I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!”"* (Galatians 2:21)

*"... that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith."* (Philippians 3:8-9)

I could list many more such truths, but I believe this is sufficient. I'll use the anchor points mentioned above to evaluate John's theology. As I previously stated, if John's theological points are on the same plane of truth as Paul's, they will be completely in agreement.

Here is a collection of John Epistles study notes.

##  [<u>1 John 1-2:6</u>]({{ site.url }}{% post_url bible-studies/John-Epistles/2022-09-15-1John-ch1-ch2-v6 %})

The key concepts gathered from the study of this passage: 1) If we walk in the light, 2) To know God is to keep his commandment, 3) To abide in Christ is to walk just as Jesus walked.
