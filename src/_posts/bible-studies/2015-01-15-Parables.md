title: "The Parables of Jesus"
excerpt: "Reflections on some of Jesus' parables which were often misunderstood or misinterpreted. Virtually all who received Jesus' teaching through them, no matter how earnest they were, tend to view them through the eyes of the flesh, through a worldly perspective. When Jesus talks of the rebirth, Nicodemus automatically assumes that it had to be through the physical means of going back to his mother's womb, while others ask Jesus what they'd have to \"DO\" to inherit eternal life, and His disciples asked Him what the works of God were so they could \"DO\" them. No one realized that there were nothing they could \"DO\" for God's Kingdom."

> <sup>10</sup>When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. <sup>11</sup>He said to them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those outside, everything is in parables, <sup>12</sup>so that although they look they may look but not see, and although they hear they may hear but not understand, so they may not repent and be forgiven (Mark 4:10-12)."
