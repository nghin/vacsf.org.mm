    <i><span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">“<sup>11</sup>Dear friends, if God so loved us, then we also ought to love one another. <sup>12</sup>No one has seen God at any time. <strong>If we love one another, God resides in us, and his love is perfected in us</strong>. <sup>13</sup><strong>By this we know</strong> that we reside in God and he in us: in that he has given us of his Spirit. <sup>14</sup>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. <sup>15</sup>If anyone <strong>confesses that Jesus is the Son of God</strong>, God resides in him and he in God. <sup>16</sup>And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has in us. God is love, and <strong>the one who resides in love resides in God</strong>, and God resides in him. <sup>17</sup>By this love is perfected with us, so that we may have <strong>confidence in the day of judgment</strong>, because just as Jesus is, so also are we in this world. <sup>18</sup>There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears punishment has not been perfected in love. <sup>19</sup>We love because he loved us first. <sup>20</sup>If anyone says “I love God” and yet <strong>hates his fellow Christian, he is a liar</strong>, because the one who does not love his fellow Christian whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. <sup>21</sup>And <strong>the commandment we have</strong> from him is this: that <strong>the one who loves God should love his fellow Christian too</strong>."

Let us now examine some of the key concepts proposed by John in the preceding passage.

## IF WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>“<sup>12</sup><strong>If we love one another, God resides in us</strong>, and his love is perfected in us. ... <sup>16</sup><strong>the one who resides in love resides in God</strong>, and God resides in him. ... <sup>20</sup>If anyone says “I love God” and yet <strong>hates his fellow Christian, he is a liar</strong>. <sup>21</sup>And <strong>the commandment we have</strong> from him is this: that <strong>the one who loves God should love his fellow Christian too</strong>.</i></span> (1 John 4:12,16,20,21) 

The flow of thought in the above-quoted John's verses appears to communicate that our salvation is contingent on our ability to love our fellow Christians. This topic has already been thoroughly discussed as we studied 1 John 2:9-11, 3:10-11, and 4:8. John's emphasis on love is not an exhortation to love one another, but a commandment that if we do not fulfill, we will lose our salvation: *"If anyone says “I love God” and yet hates his fellow Christian, he is a liar"* (v. 20).

## BY THIS WE KNOW

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>“<sup>13</sup><strong>By this we know</strong> that we reside in God and he in us: in that <strong>he has given us of his Spirit</strong>.</i> </span> (1 John 4:13) 

How does John know God has bestowed the Holy Spirit on him? Is it just a feeling? An exprience? Or was it because he obeyed the commandment to love? On the other hand, I don't place my faith in those feelings or in my ability to fulfill the love commandment. Instead, I believe God has sent me his Holy Spirit as he promised.

> John answered them all, “I baptize you with water, but one more powerful than I am is coming – I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. (Luke 3:16)
>
> <sup>7</sup>But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I am going away. For if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you. (John 16:7)
>
> <sup>13</sup>And when you heard the word of truth (the gospel of your salvation) – when you believed in Christ – you were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit, <sup>14</sup>who is the down payment of our inheritance, until the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of his glory. (Ephesians 1:13)

Seeking a sign of the Holy Spirit through feelings and experiences is dangerous because they are fleeting and unreliable. However, God's word is trustworthy because his promise cannot be broken.

> If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, since he cannot deny himself. (2 Tim 2:13)

The just will walk by faith.

## IF ANYONE CONFESSES

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>“<sup>15</sup>If anyone <strong>confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God resides in him</strong> and he in God.</i> </span> (1 John 4:13) 

This verse could refer to what Jesus said in Matthew and Luke gospels.

> <sup>32</sup>“Whoever, then, acknowledges me before people, I will acknowledge before my Father in heaven. <sup>33</sup>But whoever denies me before people, I will deny him also before my Father in heaven. (Matthew 10:32-33&mdash;NET)
>
> <sup>8</sup>“I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before God’s angels. <sup>9</sup>But the one who denies me before men will be denied before God’s angels. (Luke 12:8-9&mdash;NET)

I'm almost certain Jesus was addressing religious leaders or those who took pride in their ability to uphold the laws and statutes of the Old Covenant. These people have a lot to lose in terms of their religious standing. One such example is Nicodemus. As a religious leader, he risks exposing himself by visiting Jesus at night to inquire about salvation. Knowing each person's weakness, Jesus always comes up with a challenge that exposes people's true sinful nature. As a result, I don't believe this is a requirement for salvation for all of humanity, because even demons or demon-possessed people recognize Jesus as the Son of God.

We already discussed this topic at some length when we studied [verses 1 and 2](https://vacsf.org/john-epistles/1John-ch4-v1-11/) in the same chapter.

## CONFIDENCE IN THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i><sup>16</sup>God is love, and the one who <strong>resides in love resides in God</strong>, and God resides in him. <sup>17</sup><strong>By this</strong> love is perfected with us, so that we may have <strong>confidence in the day of judgment</strong>, because <strong>just as Jesus is, so also are we</strong> in this world.</i> </span> (1 John 4:13) 

This ***"confidence in the day of judgment"*** is based on a rather subjective notion of whether or not one ***"resides in love."***  This gospel of John is based on whether or not I reside in love, rather than on Christ, who is the only One who can fully save us. Can you say you live in love? Based on his responses to Jesus' two questions about whether he lived in love, Peter didn't think so (John 21:15-17).

Our confidence in the day of judgment must be founded on something more substantial than a fleeting feeling of love. Though some people prefer to define love as an action rather than a feeling, the end result is the same.

> If I give away everything I own, and if I give over my body in order to boast, but do not have love, I receive no benefit. (1 Cor 13:3)

An action that appears to be loving is not always proof that it is done out of love.

According to 1 John 4:21, when John asks you to ***"reside in love,"*** he means to ***"love your fellow Christians."***

I can only rely on Christ's love, not my own.

Can anyone claim to be ***"just as Jesus is"***? Let us grant John the benefit of the doubt and assume that he simply meant that we can be as loving as Jesus is. Then let me rephrase the question: Can anyone claim to love like Jesus?

If to ***"reside in love"*** and be ***"just as Jesus is"*** are required, no ones can have confidence in the day of judgement.
