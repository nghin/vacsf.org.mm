Dear friends,

<div>
<p>
<img alt src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/1-John-teaser.jpg" style="border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;">
The first study hour, which focused on John's first letter, was full of lively debates. However, depending on each person's point of view, this letter led us to different conclusions. Here are some of the things we covered, along with my own personal comments:
</p>

Here are the verses we will cover in this study set:


> <span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);"><i>“<sup>7</sup>If we <strong>walk in the light</strong> as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. (1 John 1:7)<br /><sup>3</sup>Now by this we know that we have come to <strong>know God: if we keep his commandments</strong>. <sup>4</sup>The one who says “I have come to know God” and yet does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in such a person. (1 John 2:3-4)<br /><sup>5</sup>But <strong>whoever obeys his word</strong>, truly in this person <u>the love of God has been perfected</u>. By this we know that we are <u>in him</u>. <sup>6</sup>The one who says he resides in God ought himself to <strong>walk just as Jesus walked.</strong> (1 John 2:5-6)”</i></span>

## WALK IN THE LIGHT

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
*“<sup>7</sup>If we <strong>walk in the light</strong> as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.”* (1 John 1:7)
</span>

The phrase *"walk in the light"* is frequently used in evangelistic tracts to invite the unbelieving world to enter the light by following Jesus Christ. So it would makes sense if John writes this "tract" to unbelievers. However, the flow of thought in subsequent verses leads me to believe he is writing to believers already in Christ. Consider 1 John 3:10: *"Whoever does not love his fellow Christian - is not of God."* It is clear from this verse that John is writing to believers.

According to sermons I've heard for decades, your *"walk in the light"* is determined by whether you do a good or bad thing at any given time. The moment you sin, you enter the darkness. So, how often have you gone in and out of the light, if this is your interpretation of walking in the light?

To follow Jesus, or believe in him, means to admit one's sinful condition and place one's trust, or faith, in his finished work on the cross for salvation. This commitment is not contingent on your ability or inability to keep the commandments.

> For we consider that a person is <strong>declared righteous by faith apart from the works of the law</strong>. (Romans 3:28)

So following Jesus is an act of faith in him, regardless of whether any law is followed or broken. This brings us to Jesus' definition of walking in the light:

> I am the light of the world! The one who <strong>follows me</strong> will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. (John 8:12)

Walking in the light, we can conclude, does not imply continuing to avoid evil and do good, but rather believing in the One whom God has sent (John 6:29). To put it another way, to trust Christ as your Savior. Walking in the light is thus a result of faith in Christ rather than a prerequisite for salvation. God's light simply shines upon you. You've benefited from that light. That light does not turn on and off based on your legal performance; it remains lit because God keeps his promise to those who believe in him.

I hope this is what John is trying to teach, but I have my doubts.

## KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
*“<sup>3</sup>Now by this we know that we have come to <strong>know God: if we keep his commandments</strong>. <sup>4</sup>The one who says “I have come to know God” and yet does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in such a person.”* (1 John 2:3-4)
</span>

According to John 17:3, knowing God is synonymous with having eternal life or being declared righteous, but there is a condition according to the above-quoted verse: *"if we keep his commandments"*. which means you must live under the law. Paul completely disagrees:

> <span style="color: rgb(0, 61, 152);">*“For no one is declared righteous before him by the works of the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.”* (Romans 3:20)<br  />*“For we consider that a person is declared righteous by faith apart from the works of the law.”* (Romans 3:28)<br  />*“For through the law I died to the law so that I may live to God.”* (Galatians 2:19)</span>

Let us contrast two definitions of salvation, one from John and one from Paul. According to John, your salvation is contingent on keeping the commandments, whereas Paul says it is contingent on faith rather than keeping the law. You are more than welcome to follow John's teaching, but be warned:

>  You who are trying to be declared righteous by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace! (Galatians 5:4)

## WALK JUST AS JESUS WALKED

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
*“<sup>5</sup>But <strong>whoever obeys his word</strong>, truly in this person <u>the love of God has been perfected</u>. By this we know that we are <u>in him</u>. <sup>6</sup>The one who says he resides in God ought himself to <strong>walk just as Jesus walked.</strong>”* (1 John 2:5-6)
</span>

How much obedience is required in order for someone's love for God to be *"perfected"*? I believe that perfect obedience is required before God's love can be perfected. But if perfect obedience is possible, Christ does not need to die.

In fact, Colossians 1:22 says something different about how we are made perfect:

> ... but now he has reconciled you <strong>by his physical body through death to present you holy, without blemish, and blameless</strong> before him (Colossians 1:22).

Let us take another look at the differences between John and Paul's salvation theology. John emphasizes obedience once more, while Paul emphasizes faith. The one relies on the power of the flesh to carry out the requirements of the law, while the other attempts to focus our attention on the author and perfecter of our faith.

Let us now consider another aspect of John's expectation: to *"walk as he walked."*

So, how did Jesus go about his business? He never committed a sin. He resurrected the dead and healed the blind, lame, and deaf. He atoned for sins. He died and then arose. He is also God. So I'm not sure how I can walk in God's footsteps. I believe he died for my sins, but living the life he did is an impossible task for my feeble humanity.
