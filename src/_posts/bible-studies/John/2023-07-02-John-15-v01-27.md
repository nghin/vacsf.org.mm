## BEAR FRUIT

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">

This chapter introduces several key concepts, including cutting and pruning, bearing fruit, remaining in Christ, obeying the commandments, and loving one another. These concepts are interconnected, and I'm aiming to interpret the entire chapter under the theme of "Bearing Fruit."

The progression of ideas in this chapter emphasizes the central concept of bearing fruit, as evidenced by the frequent repetition of the word *"fruit"* (eight times). The subsequent concepts presented in the chapter guide us on how to effectively "bear fruit" for God.

The initial condition for bearing fruit is our connection as branches to the vine, which is Christ. To maintain this connection, we must abide in Him. However, abiding in Him necessitates obedience to His commandments. His primary commandment is that we love one another, just as He has loved us. And how did He love us? He demonstrated His love by laying down His life for us.

Let's delve into the depth of the love commandment that Jesus imparts to us. He employs the Greek word "agape," signifying the highest form of love, a love that only God can fully exemplify. 

When Jesus questioned Peter three times about his love, we observe an intriguing interaction. In the first two instances, Jesus inquired if Peter "agape" Him, but Peter responded with "phileo," a type of affection associated with friendship, distinct from the profound "agape" love. Surprisingly, in the third inquiry, Jesus adapted to Peter's level and employed the term "phileo," to which Peter comfortably replied with affirmation.

Furthermore, Jesus attaches a crucial qualifier to this love commandment: "just as I have loved you." It's the "agape" love that Jesus is asking of us. Can any of us confidently assert that we are prepared to lay down our lives for our brethren? Even if we were placed in a situation demanding such sacrifice, we would remain imperfect offerings, unacceptable to God, as only Jesus stands as the flawless Lamb of God.

Now, the question arises: why would Jesus give us a commandment that seems impossible to obey? The answer to this question is rather straightforward. At this point in time, the Old Covenant is still in effect because Jesus has not yet gone to the cross to inaugurate the New Covenant. He is still emphasizing to people the futility of trying to attain God's righteousness through obedience to the commandments. Although Jesus' disciples have been with Him for some time, they have not fully grasped His plan for saving humanity from their sins and reconciling them to God.

Let's fast-forward to the book of Galatians to gain insight into how the Apostle Paul explains the purpose behind Jesus reiterating the role of the law:

> <sup>23</sup>Now <u>before faith came</u> we were held in <u>custody under the law, being kept as prisoners until the coming faith would be revealed</u>.  <sup>24</sup> Thus the law had become <u>our guardian until Christ, so that we could be declared righteous by faith</u>. (Galatians 3:23-24)

Unfortunately, many Christians don't see this transition between the covenants, they don't see that the law must stop being their guardian when Christ came. They become lukewarm Christians who serve two masters.

So, how can you continue to abide in Christ in order to bear fruit? You achieve this by approaching Christ in faith instead of clinging to the guidance of your former guardian, the law.
