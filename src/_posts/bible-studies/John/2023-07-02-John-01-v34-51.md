    <span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);"><i><sup>34</sup>I have both seen and testified that this man is the Chosen One of God.” <sup>35</sup>Again the next day John was standing there with two of his disciples. <sup>36</sup>Gazing at Jesus as he walked by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” <sup>37</sup>When John’s two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup>38</sup>Jesus turned around and saw them following and said to them, “What do you want?” So they said to him, “Rabbi” (which is translated Teacher), “where are you staying?” <sup>39</sup>Jesus answered, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. Now it was about four o’clock in the afternoon. <sup>40</sup><strong>Andrew</strong>, the brother of <strong>Simon Peter</strong>, was one of the two disciples who heard what John said and followed Jesus. <sup>41</sup>He first found his own brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is translated Christ). <sup>42</sup>Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon, the son of John.

These verses introduced new individuals to Jesus' ministries, namely Andrew, Simon Peter (also known as Cephas), Philip, and Nathanael. Nevertheless, there is something remarkable about the interaction between Jesus and Nathanael that holds valuable lessons for our own encounters with the Savior.

Despite being situated in biblical lands, Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament, almost as if it had been forgotten. The expression ***"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"*** captures the prevailing sentiment among the people of that time. This indicates that Nathanael had no prior knowledge of who Jesus was and had not acquired any understanding from his study of Scriptures.

However, when Jesus encountered Nathanael, he spoke something that appeared to come out of nowhere: ***"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit."*** This statement took Nathanael by surprise, leading him to inquire, ***"How do you know me?"***

Similar to his contemporaries, Nathanael likely spent time studying Scriptures beneath a fig tree. Yet, beyond simply being aware of Nathanael's activities, Jesus was acquainted with the specific passage he was reading. By affirming Nathanael as a person without deceit, Jesus revealed that he was aware of Nathanael's contemplation of Jacob, particularly the account of Jacob's vision of angels ascending and descending a ladder to heaven. However, Jesus went further, unveiling the true significance of that ladder: Jesus himself, who would serve as the intermediary between God and humanity.

In the realm of encounters with Jesus, nothing is coincidental. Jesus possessed prior knowledge of Nathanael even before his birth, when he resided within his mother's womb. Moreover, Jesus had a purpose in mind, intending to reveal to Nathanael ***"greater things."*** Can we dare to imagine ourselves in Nathanael's position? Absolutely. It is the same Jesus who demonstrates concern for every strand of hair upon our heads and every sparrow in existence. How awe-inspiring it is to comprehend that the God of the entire universe takes a personal interest in each one of us. Just as Jesus knew Nathanael, he also knows me and you.
