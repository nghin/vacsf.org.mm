Because the rest of Colossians, chapters 3 and 4, contain only exhortations rather than foundational doctrines, I'll leave it up to the class students and our readers to read them for their own edification.

As each Sunday School class recap becomes available, this series will grow weekly. If you find these studies useful in your Christian walk, you are welcome to join us on Zoom for our weekly Sunday School Bible Study.
