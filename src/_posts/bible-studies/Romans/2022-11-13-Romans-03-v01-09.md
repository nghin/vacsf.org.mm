## ISRAEL AS GOD'S CHANNEL OF PEACE
<div>

<img alt src="http://vacsf.org/assets/images/Romans-teaser.png" style="border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;">
<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);"><i>"<sup>1</sup>Therefore what advantage does the Jew have, or what is the value of circumcision? <sup>2</sup>Actually, there are many advantages. First of all, <strong>the Jews were entrusted</strong> with the oracles of God. (Romans 3:1-2)."</i></span><br />
    Paul tells them that it was also through them that God revealed the gospel to mankind after contrasting the inferior physical circumcision of the Jew with the true circumcision in the heart by the Holy Spirit. Considering that the elimination of their sinful nature via Christ's death on the cross is typified by their bodily circumcision.

Although Paul questioned the true value of physical circumcision in terms of its ability to fit people into God's kingdom, he affirms its value as a foreshadowing of the true heart circumcision by the Holy Spirit, where Israel has the honor of serving as God's chosen vessel for the delivery of his oracles.

## I'M SPEAKING IN HUMAN TERMS

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>3</sup>What then? If some did not believe, does their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God? <sup>4</sup>Absolutely not! Let God be proven true, and every human being shown up as a liar, just as it is written: "SO THAT YOU WILL BE JUSTIFIED IN YOUR WORDS AND WILL PREVAIL WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED." <sup>5</sup>But <strong>if our unrighteousness</strong> demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is he? (<strong>I am speaking in human terms</strong>.) <sup>6</sup>Absolutely not! For otherwise how could God judge the world? <sup>7</sup>For <strong>if by my lie</strong> the truth of God enhances his glory, why am I still actually being judged as a sinner? <sup>8</sup>And <strong>why not say, "Let us do evil</strong> so that good may come of it"? - as <strong>some who slander us</strong> allege that we say. (Their condemnation is deserved!)"</i></span> (Romans 3:3-8)

Paul seems a little thrown off by his opponents' glib defenses. They question why no one believes what God says if his message is so true. They contend that if their sinfulness increases God's righteousness, then why should they be punished? Some even go so far as to claim that Paul's message compels individuals to sin,  claiming that Paul said, ***"By my lie, the truth of God magnifies his glory."***

This chapter helps me in demonstrating the error of those who are reluctant to spread the good news of God's grace or who decide not to spread it at all out of fear that others may abuse it and commit sin. God's promise that everyone who believes will have their sins forgiven endures despite the possibility that some will use his mercy as a justification for sin.

It's merely an unfounded claim. Nobody encourages people to sin by preaching the gospel.

## ALL UNDER SIN

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>9</sup>What then? Are we better off? Certainly not, for we have already charged that Jews and Greeks alike are <strong>all under sin</strong>."</i></span> (Romans 2:25-29)

Due to the fact that everyone has a wicked nature thanks to Adam, no one is better than the other.
