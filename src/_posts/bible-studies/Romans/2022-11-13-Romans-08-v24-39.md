## HOPE FOR WHAT WE DO NOT SEE
<div>

    <span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);"><i>"<sup>24</sup>For <strong>in hope we were saved</strong>. Now <strong>hope that is seen is not hope</strong>, because who hopes for what he sees? <sup>25</sup>But <strong>if we hope for what we do not see</strong>, we eagerly wait for it with endurance."</i></span> (Romans 8:24-25)<br />The statement <i>"In hope we are saved"</i> suggests that the object of our hope is not yet in our possession. However, based on the previous verse we discussed last Sunday, we understand what we are hoping for: <i>"We eagerly await our adoption, the redemption of our bodies"</i> (Romans 8:23).</p>

What is your hope for something that is not visible in the present? If your hope is for eternal life, which will only be realized when Christ returns, then it is because the life you are currently living is not eternal; it is subject to decay, just like the rest of the universe. As stated in Romans 8:22, *"the whole creation groans and suffers together."*

There are believers who hold the belief that salvation encompasses both eternal life and present physical healing. If this is true, and seeking God's kingdom and righteousness grants us eternal life with the added blessing of physical healing, then it raises the question: if our faith is enough for eternal salvation, why would we need additional faith to receive physical healing? Would it then imply that if one lacks sufficient faith for physical healing, they are also lacking in salvation?

Hope that is seen is not hope, and If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable (1 Cor 15:19).

## INEXPRESSIBLE GROANINGS

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>26</sup>In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how we should pray, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with <strong>inexpressible groanings</strong>. <sup>27</sup>And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes on behalf of the saints according to God's will."</i></span> (Romans 8:26-27)

What could be the source of our deep inward groaning? Is it not the very pains and sufferings that have afflicted humanity ever since their departure from the Garden of Eden?

## ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>28</sup>And we know that <strong>all things work together for good</strong> for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose, <sup>29</sup>because those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that his Son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. <sup>30</sup>And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also <strong>justified</strong>; and those he justified, he also <strong>glorified</strong>."</i></span> (Romans 8:28-30)

In the end, every circumstance, whether we perceive it as positive or negative, is working together for our benefit, as indicated by the latter part of the verse: *"those he justified, he also glorified."* This represents God's ultimate intention for us, and He orchestrates events to lead us to that final destination in His plan.

## IF GOD IS FOR US

<span style="color: rgb(159, 29, 33);">
<i>"<sup>31</sup>What then shall we say about these things? <strong>If God is for us, who can be against us?</strong>  <sup>32</sup>Indeed, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all - <strong>how will he not also, along with him, freely give us all things?</strong>  <sup>33</sup><strong>Who will bring any charge</strong> against God's elect? It is God who justifies.  <sup>34</sup><strong>Who is the one who will condemn?</strong> Christ is the one who died (and more than that, he was raised), who is at the right hand of God, and who also is interceding for us. <sup>35</sup><strong>Who will separate us</strong> from the love of Christ? Will trouble, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?  <sup>36</sup>As it is written, "For your sake we encounter death all day long; we were considered as sheep to be slaughtered."  <sup>37</sup>No, <strong>in all these things we have complete victory</strong> through him who loved us! <sup>38</sup>For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor heavenly rulers, nor things that are present, nor things to come, nor powers, <sup>39</sup>nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."</i></span> (Romans 8:31-39)

God's plan for us cannot be thwarted by anything.
