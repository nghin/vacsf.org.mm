title: "Be Ye Perfect"
excerpt: "A king preparing for combat or a tower builder weighing their chances of victory are both depicted in Jesus' parable in Luke 14. Despite Jesus' call for perfection as a prerequisite for entering God's kingdom, very few people do so."

## Not one iota will pass

<img alt src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/be-ye-perfect-teaser.jpg" style="border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;">

In Matthew 5:18, Jesus stated unequivocally, *"... Until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. (NIV)"* Then he followed up with a law that should strike fear into the hearts of all people seeking to enter God's kingdom:

> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. (Matthew 5:48 - KJV)

Despite this, many Christians appear to be unaware of its implications. Countless books and sermons have been produced and preached in the hope of raising Christians to a greater degree of spirituality, despite their obvious futility. The majority of Bible commentaries are no exception.

The concept of man's self-empowerment toward godhood is central to all faiths around the world. Repeated incarnations and various forms of self-denial are advocated as a way to break away from the cycle of birth and death by conquering the wicked flesh. For Christians, there are certain good things they should do and some bad things they should avoid in order to improve their relationship with God and have a better confidence of their salvation. Most people believe that their lives are a work in progress. It's known as the sanctification process.

Those who believe in reincarnation do better in this regard since they feel that one day they will achieve perfection, although through an unending number of trials. What about the Christians, though? They only have one chance to reach perfection before they meet God, as stated in 2 Corinthians 5:10: *"For we must all come before the judgment seat of Christ,..."*

## The young ruler

In Matthew 19, we read about a rich young ruler who came to meet Jesus and asked him what good things he needed to do to inherit God's kingdom, and he received the following response from the Author of the Law:

> If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me . (Matthew 19:21)

This young man boasted that he was able to keep all of Jesus's commandments. One problem that he hadn't expected was that the printed law didn't explicitly state: *"sell your possessions and give to the poor,"* the saying goes. Jesus was a master at bringing a guy down, especially a devout one. There's no way to hide behind the fig leaves of one's good deeds from what the Bible says about one's genuine state:

> For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)

The young ruler, like many modern Christians, thought he could achieve perfection through good deeds, but Jesus knew better, for he himself inspired the prophet Isaiah to declare since ancient time that all man's *"righteous acts are like filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6)"* which can never restore fallen man to their lost glory.

As a result, while Jesus stated that people must become perfect before entering God's kingdom, his ultimate aim was to inform humanity that perfection belongs solely to God and that he will never share his glory with flesh and blood.

## An honest assessment

What is your self-assessment of where you stand on the perfection scale if you follow the road of progressive sanctification? Have you come a long way since the day you declared Jesus to be your Savior and Lord? How long do you believe it will take you to meet the Lord? Where do you think you'll be in ten years if you keep going at this rate? What if you're supposed to meet him tonight? Will you be good enough to enter his kingdom?

What is your success rate as a teacher teaching others this progressive sanctification? And, maybe more crucially, what is your own self-evaluation? A pastor compares the effort to purge oneself of one's sin nature to attempting to jump to the moon. Using this comparison, we would ask: how can a man who has never succeeded in his attempt to jump to the moon teach others how to do so?

Trying your hardest will not suffice, and dismissing Jesus' insistence on perfection will not suffice. When Jesus said that not a single stroke of a pen would be erased from the law, he meant it. Anyone should have no doubt that they must be fully perfect on or before the day of reckoning:

> "... holiness, without which no man shall see God." (Hebrews 12:14)

## A quick detour: sanctification

Theologically, sanctification is defined as reserving something for a certain purpose as intended by the designer. In practice, however, the word usually has a very different connotation. It is commonly used to refer to cleanliness, holiness, morality, virtue, and so on. Most Bible professors advocate a notion known as progressive sanctification, which states that a Christian must strive to become more and more sanctified until they reach perfection.

While we're on the subject, let us examine our own growth and ask ourselves: Is it true that I am becoming more like my Savior with each passing day? More affection? More endurance? Slower to become enraged? A student just needs to take an exam to understand his current position as well as progress since the prior examination with a reasonable degree of accuracy. It's unclear how we may accomplish this in our spiritual lives. 

Many years ago, my wife and I spent a couple of hours on a Saturday signing up for classes to master new talents. My wife took baking classes, while I took voice lessons. After nearly two hours of listening to the instructor, I departed the hotel conference room with no notion how to improve my singing voice.

Trying to mimic Christ is nothing compared to learning to sing. However, the chances of me singing like Pavarotti in this lifetime are limited to none. As a result, the possibilities of becoming like my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ must be significantly slimmer in contrast. A man may be able to learn skills that make angels jealous, but can he become like God? Not only is it an unattainable goal, but he is also repeating the original sin of attempting to become God.

The concept of gradual sanctification is such a deceit that it deprives believers of the joy of salvation, as well as the true Sabbath rest that is rightfully theirs and that no one should take away. Besides, what part of you requires sanctification? Spirit? No, the Spirit comes from God, the same One who breathed life into Adam and is now breathed into individuals who have come into a trust relationship with God through Christ. Is it possible to truly improve the Holy Spirit? Who is the third member of the Godhead? Certainly not. What about a person's non-spiritual body, soul, or flesh? Where in the Bible does it state that mortal flesh will ever join God's kingdom (1 Corinthians 15:50)? Nowhere, except in 1 Corinthians 15:52, where Paul reveals a mystery, that we will be clothed with immortality in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye. This transformation to immortality, to perfection, is not incremental, but rather instantaneous, and it will occur only when Christ returns. Furthermore, the concept of progressive sanctification suggests that we are attempting to patch up an old piece of clothing, our current flesh, with the new cloth of the gospel. At the end of this article, we will take a fast tour through Galatians 3 to see the genuine meaning of perfection and sanctification through biblical lenses.

## God's will for your life

Most people believe that God's will consists of his desires or expectations for them. Perhaps he wants them to overcome specific sins or character faults, or to be called into certain ministries, or to accomplish certain other things, among the myriad things a believer must do to get closer to where they believe their God wants them to be.

Such a perception of God's will is a prescription for a wretched Christian life, as the soul will be continuously guessing and chasing after their perceived will of God. One could wonder if they will ever reach a point of resolution before meeting their Maker.

I believe the true will of God is a description of the unfathomable inheritance that is sealed in the heavenly places by the blood of the Lamb of God for you. And if he has a yearning for you while you're still alive, it must be this:

> ... make every effort to enter that rest (Hebrews 4:11)

Do you understand what this verse means? God provided us with numerous foreshadows of rest in order to signpost to the ultimate rest from the effort of restoring man's friendship with God. The Sabbath provided physical rest for the Israelites, but it also points to our spiritual rest. Jesus spoke frequently of the rest of those who were highly burdened, but never of the physical weight that all earth residents must bear. He spoke about the spiritual load that comes with living a life attempting to get right with God.

At the end of his crucifixion, Jesus said, *"It is finished."* The process of restoring man's perfect condition before God was completed. It was completed almost two thousand years ago. Anyone who accepts his completed task and rests in it will find serenity. However, most Christians reject to enter this rest, much like the Israelites of old who refused to enter the promised land at their initial arrival and ended up walking in circles for the next 40 years. This rest is so essential that the author of Hebrews refers to their rejection to enter the promised land as rebellion.

> So, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in **the rebellion**, during the time of testing in the wilderness, where your ancestors tested and tried me, though for forty years they saw what I did. That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray, and **they have not known my ways**.’ So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘**They shall never enter my rest**.’ ” (Hebrews 3:7-11)

The rebellion was the reluctance to enter the promised land, which the Lord referred to as his REST, the location where the job of redeeming man was completed. God's *"ways"* are the ways of trusting in what Christ has done, not the ways of the flesh or relying on obedience to the law to acquire righteousness. As a result, God unleashed his anger on those who rejected his free gift of salvation and refused to enter his rest.

This topic of God's wrath towards those who refuse to walk by grace is expanded upon in the Galatians epistle, which we shall look at later. Let us be reminded once more that God's greatest wish for us is that we fully enter that realm of rest, or rather that we fully comprehend God's grace.

> Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. (2 Peter 3:18)

## Galatians 3 &mdash; Faith or Works of the Law?

It has been four years since I first wrote a study on [<em><u>Galatians 3</u></em>]({{ site.url }}{% post_url bible-studies/Galatians/2015-05-18-Galatians-Chapter-03 %}) around the middle of 2015. Since then, I've learned a lot about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ (2 Peter 3:18). This second writing is meant to provide additional background in order to better understand Jesus' genuine objective in his almost parabolic command: *"Be Ye Perfect."*

Let us now look at Galatians 3.

### Galatians 3:1-4

> <sup>1</sup>You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. <sup>2</sup>I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law,or by believing what you heard? <sup>3</sup>Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh? <sup>4</sup>Have you experienced so much in vain—if it really was in vain?

Whatever the Galatians were doing, they pretended that Jesus had not been crucified. Because they would have conducted their Christian lives differently if they had believed he was.

Paul began by asking the Galatians how they become Christians, whether by embracing the gospel message or by obeying the regulations outlined in the law. Paul contrasted the two paths they may have taken to salvation, and it was apparent that he expected them to respond correctly, that faith, or believing, was the only path acceptable to God. Then he chastised them for how they chose to carry out the rest of their Christian lives. They were reliant on human efforts, on the power of their flesh.

Take note of the term *"finish"* that Paul used in his scolding. Other translations use the terms *"perfected"* or *"completed."* Paul knew the Galatians didn't believe in Christ's finished work, so they thought they weren't perfect even though Christ had died for them once and for all. This is the same mistake that is still being perpetrated today. All you have to do is search the term "progressive sanctification" on the internet to find the same doctrine being spread.

### Galatians 3:5-6

>  <sup>5</sup>So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? <sup>6</sup>So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”

Paul reaffirmed what he said in verses 1-4: righteousness comes only through faith, and all Abraham needed was confidence in God.

### Galatians 3:7-9

> <sup>7</sup>Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham. <sup>8</sup>Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.” <sup>9</sup>So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.

Keep in mind as you read these lines that Paul was emphasizing faith over works of the law, and he kept repeating it ad nauseam to impress upon us the value of faith. The actual children of Abraham include those who rely on faith as well as those who are not necessarily biologically related to him, notably the Gentiles.

### Galatians 3:10-14

> <sup>10</sup>For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.” <sup>11</sup>Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.” <sup>12</sup>The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, “The person who does these things will live by them.”<sup>13</sup>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.” <sup>14</sup>He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.

There is no need to explain the significance of these verses. They are speaking for themselves. But, for the sake of clarity, let's go through the important points. What exactly does it mean to *"rely on the law"?* Religious individuals rely on the law, or the fulfillment of the law's provisions, to reconcile themselves with God. However, as we see in verse 11, the works of the law will NOT get someone *"justified before God."*

"The law is not dependent on faith," states verse 12. It is so because justification involves deeds, which cannot occur, as stated in verse 11. Faith is based on an object outside of oneself, namely Jesus Christ and everything he has done, but the law is based on the performance of the flesh. One focuses on Christ, while the other focuses on self.

As a result, those who rely on the law are truly cursed. It is a curse because those who must *"continue to accomplish everything written in the Book of the Law"* have no rest. They must keep going because the works of the law will not get them there. These actions are similar to the old covenant's repetitive offering of sacrifices that could not atone for sins (Hebrews 10:1-4).

*"The person who does these things will live by them,"* says Verse 12. These are the works of the law; so, people who rely on the law must meet the specific standards of the law.

*"Christ rescued us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us,"* says verse 13. Christians are frequently taught that obeying the law is necessary for spiritual progress, however verse 13 refers to the law as a curse that Christ has freed us from. The Bible expressly permits us to live independent from the law.

Finally, in verse 14, it says, *"By faith, we might receive the promise of the Spirit."*  Receiving the Spirit is equivalent to receiving eternal life. This verse emphasizes how the Spirit is received: through faith, not through the works of the law.

In summary, if no good deed can get you into heaven, how can there be any activity that makes you more acceptable to God, as progressive sanctification proponents propose?

### Galatians 3:23-26

> <sup>23</sup>Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. <sup>24</sup>So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. <sup>25</sup>Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. <sup>26</sup>So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, 27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.

Verse 23: *"Before the coming of this faith."* This faith is the faith that says *"Believe in the One God has sent and you shall be saved (John 6:29),"* and not the faith that places confidence in human effort.  We were under the law only until the arrival of the faith that saves. The law was our *"guardian"* only temporarily until Christ comes. And Paul repeated it again: we became children of God *"through faith."*

## Be Ye Perfect

Receiving the Holy Spirit is receiving everlasting life, receiving the Life that God poured into Adam when He created the world. However, in order for God to reside in your heart, one condition must be met: you must be perfect. But are you sure? You are not, since *"all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23),"* and *"none is righteous, no, not one (Romans 3:10),"* and *"all our righteous acts are like filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6)."* So, how did you become so pure and holy that God could live in your heart? Because we are all *"justified freely by his grace through the redemption that comes through Christ Jesus" (Romans 3:24).*

We are flawless because we have been justified, and it is by grace through faith, not by our greatest deeds.

## The truth shall set you free

The truth about our justification liberates us, allowing us to genuinely know God. There is no longer any need to hide for fear of being condemned, because God's complete approval permits us to freely come into the brightness of his presence and commune with him. There is no longer a desire to measure up, to conquer the unreachable wall of perfection, but as the song goes, there is "rest beyond the river."

The constant pursuit of perfection by man via his own fleshly effort demonstrates just one thing: his pride, for where there is work, there is pride and bragging.

> Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith. (Romans 3:27)

The solution for the incurable perfectionist is found here: Christ has already made you perfect via his redemption on the cross. Christ has set you free in order for you to know him.

No one will enter the kingdom of heaven if God insists that the Be-Ye-Perfect command, or any of the Ten Commandments, or any commandment that has dwelled in man's conscience since they acquired the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden, be fulfilled. Don't even try, and don't try to teach others how to accomplish what you can't. The command *"Be Ye Perfect"*, and many others like it in the Old Covenant setting, were given by Jesus to demonstrate man's total helplessness and need for God's grace and mercies. He sought to persuade them to enter into a New Covenant relationship with him.

> <sup>24</sup>What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? <sup>25</sup>Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin. (Romans 7:24-25&mdash;NIV)

Perfection belongs to God alone.
