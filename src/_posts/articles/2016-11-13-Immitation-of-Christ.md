CHAPTER I<br />
Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and all its vanities<br />
1. He that follows me shall not walk in darkness(1), says the Lord. There are the words of Christ; and they teach us how far we must imitate His life and character, if we seek true illumination, and deliverance from all blindness of heart. Let it be our most earnest study, therefore, to dwell upon the life of Jesus Christ.

Above is an excerpt from The Immitation of Christ by Thomas A. Kempis, the first paragraph of chapter 1.

## Recollection of my early years in Christ

After years of trying to find life's meaning in existentialism, and shorter periods of looking into Transcendental Meditation and Hinduism, I found my hope in Christ. It was there in Christianity that I found true hope. In other paths, I was on my own, but in Christ I found a source of strength that was outside of me; the suffocating dark tunnel without end opened up to a sense of hope that was real and lasting; that was 30 years ago, and that peace never left. Then I began to devour every Christian devotional book I could lay my hands on; and one among that giant pile of books was Thomas A. Kempis' Immitation of Christ.
