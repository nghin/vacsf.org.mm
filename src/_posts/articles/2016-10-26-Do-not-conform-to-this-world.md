title: "Do Not Conform"
excerpt: "The full title for this writing should be: Do not conform to the patterns of this world. This article begs to differ with virtually all known commentaries and messages from pulpits everywhere that it does not mean what they generally propose."

## The world and the flesh

<img alt src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/do-not-conform-teaser.png" style="border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;">
The general consensus is the world, whose definition we'll explore later, is something negative that we must take care not to conform to its patterns. This negative something is generally accepted as sinful things that we must get rid of from our lives. The more of these sins we can get rid of, the closer we are to God. Oftentimes Hebrews 12:1 is brought into the picture to support the argument that we should make every effort to get rid of <em>"the sin that easily entangles."</em>

A quick survey of all available commentaries reveals that they also hold the same interpretation, or perhaps they influence the rest of Christianity with their points of views? Ah but people don't really need commentaries to form this world view, all you need is take a survey of some of the major world's religions, they all hold the same concept of sins and the need to deal with them in various ways.

All religions hold the belief that the flesh is basically sinful, a negative force that must be subdued or even annihilated if one hopes to achieve a higher state of being.

It should not be a surprise to us that Christians, most if not almost all, also subscribe to this mode of thinking though it may be dressed in a more appropriate Christian language.

## The world, flesh, and sin

Let's talk about the world. What are these patterns of the world? What is it about them that the apostle Paul had to warn folks not to conform to? Most commentaries are very long winded about what constitutes "the world," but to simplify the matter, the dividing line is between what is sinful and what is not. Then it logically follows that the command "do not conform to the patterns of this world" can be restated as simply as "do not sin anymore." Does this make sense? Isn't this what is implied in all sermons and writings?

The absolute truth about Christ is He had to endure the cross to take care of the problem of sin, so man may through Him be accepted into the Kingdom of God. He did not die for any other reason than that. Therefore the fundamental problem with man is sin, everything else is like pimples on a man with leprosy.

## Vanishingly probable

Is it possible for anyone to be completely without sin?  The answer is easy right from the Bible itself, therefore if "do not conform" is to be understood in the conventional sense, we're setting ourselves up for a lifetime of discouragement and hopelessness because the fact of our daily transgression will stare at us in the face on a continual basis. I read that Martin Luther used to take 6 hours per day to confess his sins, but I believe that had Luther, or the listening priest, had the strength, he would have had confessed all day long.

## The Christian things that we do

Though most pulpits do not preach outright, but most pew sitters assume this is what they heard: worldly things are those not directly related to Bible study, church activities, ministries, evangelistic endeavors, prayer, etc. The way to please God is to do as many of these things as possible. We read in John 6:25-29 that upon hearing Jesus' teaching, the crowd asked Him what the works of God were so that they could do them. People also asked Paul in Acts 16:30 about what they must do to be saved. The same type of questions were posed to Jesus in the gospels.

There is a lady in our church who works very hard to provide for her family with many sick people. Occasionally in our Sunday School class she would express her regret that she could not find time to do "God's works." I tried very hard to convince her that God's works are those things she does when she works in her nail salon, when she cares for her sick husband and his sibblings, when she tries to catch a breath from between many responsibilities. In her mind these are "worldly things" that don't count toward God's kingdom. But it's not just this lady, it's probably 99.99% of folks you sit next to every Sunday singing hymns of grace.

Where does this understanding, or rather misunderstanding, come from? Where else but from the neglect of preachers to ground their flocks in the absolute promise of salvation to those who call by Jesus' name.
