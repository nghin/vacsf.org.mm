The question most often asked by Christians is, \"what is the will of God for my life?\" Many books have been written with the express purpose of showing readers how to get an answer to this question. However most missed the true meaning of the will of God for those who are seeking it for their lives.

God creates man with a heart that longs for meaning, for a sense of purpose, and self-worth, reflecting King David's assessment of himself: <em>"I praise you because I'm fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm139:14)."</em> But sadly their hearts are now empty, and there is nothing in this world that can fill that God-shaped vacuum. However this article is not an apologetic about man's need for God, but about people who already believe in God yet they're still lost. Perhaps they're not lost in relation to their place in God's kingdom, but lost between this present time and when God calls them home, and they found their lives in Christ anything but abundant. Might this also be the reason why many Christians do not have that blessed assurance of their salvation?

## Before I became a Christian

This may not apply to those who were born and raised in a Christian environment, but perhaps the same thing may still hold true for most of them as many will only develop a genuine faith in Christ much later in life. It is during such time that there is much confusion, many questions unanswered, many concerns about the future, the desperate longing for the meaning of life, a natural need for a sense of belonging, and infinite possibilities of needs that are expressed in different shapes or forms.

As for me, the reading of Hermann Hesse' Steppen Wolf during my early college years triggered a torrent of existential questions that served as an outlet from an attempt to find answers for these nagging questions. The author's thoughts served as stimuli for my own thoughts as I tried to navigate my inner landscape. The multitude of thoughts though were very entertaining at first, gradually became unbearable as they circled endlessly without coming to a destination.

## After I became a Christian

After more than a decade of trying to think my way out of the maze of life through existential thoughts, and dabbling in Trancendental Meditation and a study of the Bhagavad Gita through a commentary by a Hindu guru and various other literature, God opened my eyes to the wonderful gospel of Jesus Christ. An image I like to use to describe this life changing event is I saw Christ's invitation for me as a perfect jump off point out of the vicious cycle, the treadmill, of self help salvation that promised but did not deliver. I felt a wonderful sense of a lightness of being as never before; a great burden fell off my back; a peaceful feeling that my feet were firmly planted on the ground, I can settle down and start building a life as any normal human being would. It was such a wonderful feeling of being at peace with the world, not having to try to escape anymore as I used to in my recurring dreams.

But the initial joy of salvation proved to be short lived. The quest for life's meaning is now translated into the pursuit of the will of God. The difference is now God is in the picture. I used to be accountable to myself but now it's God I will have to answer to. Though the scope of the pursuit for meaning is much smaller, it's still large enough to cause any Christian great consternation.

It didn't take long before I got back on the treadmill of performance. My recurring nightmares of being lost somewhere, or losing something precious, or falling so far behind in my classwork that there was no way to catch up, are now replaced with dreams of being a missionary in some remote corner of the world. Though they were not nightmares, they were unfulfilled dreams nonetheless. The volume of Christian literature kept me busy for several years but there were still many questions unanswered. What is God's will for my life? How can I serve Him? Trips to downtown neighborhood telling folks of the great news of Jesus Christ provided some meaning and satisfaction for but a short while; many times during those trips I wondered if I really knew what I was telling folks about Jesus' promises of burden lifted and rest for the weary souls. I was like a salesman who was trying to sell folks a product he's never benefitted from.

## Some Bible references on God's will

Let's consider some frequently quoted Bible references that appear to tell us what the will of God is for believers.

> <sup>3</sup>For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; <sup>4</sup>that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, <sup>5</sup>not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God. (1 Thess 4:3-5)

> Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. (1 Thess 5:18)

From these references we read that the will of God for us are at least avoiding sexual temptations and being always filled with gratitude. How about God's will for us concerning tithing, fruit of the Spirit, evangelism, godly characters, Bible study, relationship, greed, jealousy, pride, wisdom, anger, hypocrisy, honesty, and many other good things? How's everybody doing in these areas as well as all that are among the good and the bad?

The two passages cited above are by no means an exhaustive list of all of God's wills for our lives, but they're all about our flesh. At the risk of getting ahead of myself, these wills that God has for us are not for Him, but for us, for our own good, but they're still only about this life, about "all these things" on this side of eternity. God has not wills, but a will, a single testament, that He left for us before he died on the cross. This will pertains to eternity, to relationships not between man and man but between man and God. But let's leave this will here for a while before we come back to it a little bit later.

## It's all sin

Usually people think of sin as something that is obviously sinful such as adultery, murder, or whatever else that their faith tells them, but in reality everything that gives a person a sense of failure becomes a sin to him. God gives us the story of Job to demonstrate to us the power of a person's mind in condemning him in the situation of a failure. In Job's case it was his big loss of everything he possessed. We saw that Job's friends deduced that it must have been Job's sins that brought him to such state. Even Job himself thought he had sinned and tried to defend his righteousness. The story of the man blind since birth was also a case in point where people concluded that his failure, his blindness, is a consequence of sins.
