title: "Self Denial, the Cross, and Following Jesus"
excerpt: "Almost all Christians must have heard at least more than once sermons that encourage them to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Jesus as both a commandment and a promise that they would experience peace, joy, and ultimately a more fulfilling Christian life. Is this what Jesus had in mind when he spoke these words?"

At first glance, the three aspects of what Jesus spoke in Matthew 16:24 appear to be achievable goals, and Christians set out to achieve these goals with a vengeance. A huge amount of communication is dedicated toward teaching Christians how to achieve a measure of success toward these goals. But is a measure of success good enough? For certainly Jesus was not speaking to who were already in God's kingdom, but to the world of the condition for entering it, which amounts to following him. He is posing an impossible standard that only he could achieve: to deny himself, to bear the cross, and to follow in his footstep. This article will show that these are not challenges to see who qualify for God's kingdom, but are shouts from the One who is going to the cross: "Will you surrender?"

This article was inspired from a verse that was quoted at the end of an email. This verse, which I had heard sermons on it several times in my decades of sitting in my church pews, over the radio, or through Christian literature that I devoured in my early years as a Christian, became my life's purpose years before Rick Warren's Purpose Driven Life was written.

## Matthew 16:24
> Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me (Matthew 16:24)

If you hover over this verse Matthew 16:24 and right-click to open it in a new window or tab, you'd find a short commentary on the verse: "Discipleship is costly." This subtitle is found in the NASB, Amplified, and various other versions. No, disciple is not costly, it's priceless. It took God's only begotten Son to pay for it.

## Self denial

To what extent does Jesus ask you to deny yourself? Denying yourself of certain pleasures by restricting certain foods or drinks, or follow the pattern of the Colossians who prescribed "do not handle, do not taste, do not touch" (Colossians 2:21), or other forms of personal sacrifice? No, Hebrews 9:22 says that *"without the shedding of blood there can be no forgiveness of sins."*" And it's not just a spilling of some blood, it's all of it until death, and that was what Jesus did. He died. The condition for becoming his disciple, for following him, is not just mere denial of something, but a denial unto death through the shedding of your own blood. And even then, when you did shed your own blood, it wouldn't do you any good because you don't qualify as an unblemished sacrifice. The Old Covenant requirement for sacrificial beasts is they have to be accept by the High Priest as unblemished. Jesus is unblemished but you are not.

Now why am I talking about death when the verse only talks about self denial? Because Jesus uttered these words as a condition for salvation, not discipleship. The New Covenant was not yet made available until Christ denied himself by enduring the cross. He was asking his listener though they did not know what he was alluding to: can you endure what I'm about to endure? But of course, this is just a rhetorical question, because your death on the cross will not yield the righteousness you need for an entrance into God's kingdom, as I had alluded to earlier.

## Take up your cross

This is just a continuation of the denial of self explained above. The cross requires the one who carries it to end up at the point of death. It's not at all the kind of cross people generally think of, the cross of life's struggles, or trials and tribulations. It's the cross to pay for someone's sin, and, as discussed earlier in the self denial section, no one is qualified to endure such cross except Jesus Christ. In short, can you endure a cross to the point of death?

## Following Jesus

Once again, Jesus does not simply call men to become his disciples, but he calls them first to become children of God, citizens of his kingdom, to pass from death to life, or to put it simply to be saved. He is still preparing the world to receive his free gift of life through his death on the cross. To follow him must first mean all of the above. The work that we do as citizens of God's kingdom is just a byproduct, an inevitable consequence of us being attached to the Vine, having the full right to become children of God, and sealed by his Spirit.

## A new and living way

This verse Matthew 16:24 is not the basis of the new ministry of reconciliation, but the old ministry of condemnation. It should give any Christian a shudder had God not given us a new way to draw near to him through his Son. We'd find bodies of Christians strewn about as each attempt to obey its impossible command to make peace with God. Ah, but here's the irony, had they tried to crucify themselves, chop off their hands and feet, pluck out their eyes, sell all their possessions to give to the poor, they would have quickly found out the futility of such attempts as they still wouldn't know to what extent they must go to meet God's righteous requirements. But thankfully:

> Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a <strong>new and living way</strong> opened for us through the curtain, that is, <strong>his body</strong> (Hebrews 10:19-20)

Thankfully, it's his body, not ours.
