The Gospel of John is often given to new believers or unbelievers, but it presents a challenge as most of its content still resides within the realm of the Old Covenant. A significant portion of Jesus' teachings, particularly the parables, were shrouded in concealed meanings. Fortunately, our class has extensively explored the New Covenant through Paul's epistles, equipping us to revisit John's gospel with the necessary tools to interpret the numerous hints Jesus provided about future events following his crucifixion.
