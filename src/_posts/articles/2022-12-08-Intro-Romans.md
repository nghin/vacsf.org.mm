## Welcome To Our Sunday School

This is a second study of this book as we go through it verse by verse in our Sunday School class. The difference now is we have a far firmer knowledge of the New Covenant and the underlying foundational truths that form the basis of our understanding. I pray that the information in this study will help you to have a joyful relationship with Christ and a testimony that accurately captures your abundant life.
