## Welcome To Our Sunday School

Last Sunday, our Sunday School class began studying the book of Colossians. Since I've been writing a class summary to share with class members on a regular basis, I figured why not make it available on this website as well? This Colossians study is ongoing, so one article will be added a few days after each Sunday School class. I hope you find them useful in your Christian walk.
