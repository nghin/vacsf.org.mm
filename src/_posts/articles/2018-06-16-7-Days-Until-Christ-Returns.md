The author appeals to Jesus' command to believers to be servants of others, to the gifts God gives to each believer according to the parable of the talents, and other positive things they should do in preparing themselves for the day Christ comes again. This article will examine and rebut several faulty assumptions delivered in the sermon that was used as the basis for the action guide. The article is not written as an attack of the expositor or his ministries, but it sees the topic as emblematic of the common teachings that stunt believer's growth and put doubts in their relationship with God, and proposes a more Scriptural approach to achieve the readiness with certainty. Here's the introduction to the "7 Days Until Christ Returns - An Action Guide." 


> What would you do if you knew Jesus would return in seven days? Though the Bible clearly tells us that no man knows the date when Christ will return, it is an interesting and profound exercise to look at how our lives might change if we had the knowledge that Christ would return seven days from now. What would you do? Would your daily routine change? What is standing between you and the Lord that you would want to make right? 

## The dilemma

According to the expositor, though believers are doctrinally saved as they placed their trust in Christ, they must still face his judgement seat to give an answer to how they live while still in the flesh. Another well known expositor also gives this description of the judgement seat of Christ: *"Thus, the purpose of the judgment seat of Christ is to examine a Christian's total life. We will be recompensed for the deeds we have done, whether good or bad (2 Cor. 5:10). The term used there refers to a summing up and estimation of the total pattern of a believer's life. "*

Can the totality of a Christian's relationship with God be compartmentalized into the parts before and after they're saved, or rather the unconditional forgiveness of their sins and the conditional rewards, or the lack thereof, that follow? Is there truth in the assertion that the completely grace-based gift of eternal life and the work-based recompense of the deeds while still in the flesh are all summed up to make up the total worth of a believer's life?

A Christian journey through life usually follows a pattern where the grace-based gift of forgiveness of sins and eternal life recedes back in to the brief moment in time when the believer expressed his trust in Christ, then yielded to the long stretch of the years ahead filled with question of one's worth before the Lord: am I good enough for the Christ who is coming back? The assurance of salvation gradually fades away to the point the believer questions whether if it was even real, then subsequently if asked where he'd stand if he were to meet God this very night, his answer would most likely be one of uncertainty whether he'd be saved. The question whether he's done enough as he examines his deeds looms large in his mind, and perhaps like most believers he would instinctively pushes it to the back of his mind.

Now back to the topic from which this article was prompted to be written. The author of *"7 Days Until Christ Returns"* proposed two reasons why believers should do their utmost to prepare themselves to meet their Lord: 1) Christ's call to servanthood, and 2) the talents he's given to each and everyone. Let's examine each one.

## Servanthood

There is no need to try to convince the reader that it's a good thing to do everything possible to make the most of our lives to serve God through serving others while still here on earth; for the simple truth that a life of service brings satisfaction and a sense of joy that accompanies every good work performed. Even the worst of "saved" sinners knows that to be true and does not need to be convinced of this very basic element of common sense. Furthermore, the prophet Jeremiah conveyed to us directly from our God that he would no longer guide them from letters written in stone tablets, but directly impress his law in our hearts through the inner workings of the Holy Spirit (Jeremiah 31:32-33).

A servanthood attitude of the believer is no exception. It's the inner working of the Holy Spirit to advance his kingdom. It's not a condition for rewards or punishments but a fruit guaranteed by Christ as he promised that those who are in him will bear much fruit. And that fruit includes a servanthood attitude. Constant reminder of  the *"should's"* or *"do's"*, or their opposites, will probably do more harm than good, as the God of the New Covenant will move his subjects from within. All the extraneous exhortations come from without, and if they do spur the believers to do anything, they can only produce *"fruit for death(Romans 7:5)"* as they become a law to them. They focus the eyes of the believers upon the strength of their flesh instead of their Redeemer.

In this mindset, a doubt of their salvation will inevitably ensue as they will not know how much work they need to perform to meet certain arbitrary requirements.

## The talents

Contrary to the exhortation of the 7-Days author, the parable of the talents is not about *"recompense for the deeds done while in the flesh,"* or about rewards or the lack thereof. It's about salvation, who will be saved and who will not be. The evidence for this is in the last verse of this parable: *"As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 25:30)."* God does not call his sanctified saint *"worthless slave"* and he will not cast them into outer darkness.

Additionally, our Lord God is nothing like the slave owner in this parable. God never reaps where he does not sow. And not only does he sow, he sows the amazing seed of the gospel: his only begotten Son.

## Faulty application

So far we've seen that the two basic premises of 7-Days put the believers in a wrong place in preparing them for the day of Christ's return. Though the expositor assures listeners that they're already saved, in his encouraging them to better prepare themselves, he puts doubt in their minds that they may not be saved after all. The parable of the talents, in its being misapplied, is the principle offender. 

Beyond the doctrinally errorneous applications of the servanthood exhortation and the parable of the talents, the practical implication is also great. How much is enough of my servitude, and to whom? How many talents have I been blessed with and how have I performed? No one knows with any certainty whether his achievements will be accepted by Christ upon his return. It's all guesswork, and arbitrary. This is no way for the bridesmaids to wait for the arrival of their bridegroom.

Our faith in God, our hope of salvation, must be infinitely more certain than what is put forth in the *"7 Days Until Christ Returns."*

> Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. (Hebrews 11:1)

## The once for all perfection

> For by a single offering he has **perfected for all time** those who are sanctified (Hebrews 10:14).

This is how we should prepare ourselves for the day of Christ's return: to put our hope on what Christ had achieved for us instead of what we can produce with our flesh. If God has made us perfect in Christ, what is it that we're lacking that causes him to withhold rewards from us? Are you relying on your own sacrifices and offerings or on the *"single offering"* prepared by God himself which alone can make you *"perfect for all time?"*

Fix your eyes upon Jesus (Hebrews 12:2), my friends. That's how you prepare for 1 Day, for 7 Days, or even for the rest of your life as you await Christ' return. 

> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?  (Romans 8:32)

And if God graciously gives you all things along with his Son, will he be stingy about little things that you flesh can produce? Actually you should be glad that he's not giving you rewards for what that comes from your flesh, because if he does, you may not like it. The rewards are actually threats that if you walk according to the letter of the law, its fruit will you reap.

> *You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace (Galatians_5:4)*

## In conclusion

The Christians do not live a life of working toward rewards, but of waiting for the day they receive their **inheritance**. Rewards are unknown until they are given to their recipients, but an inheritance is known, though sealed as a promise, or a guarantee, and to be received in full just as we read in Romans 8:32.

What rewards can match the wonderful parts of our inheritance in Christ? Consider these: the indwelling Holy Spirit as a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance (Ephesians 1:11-14), the forgiveness of sins (Colossians 1:14), our sanctification and justification (1 Corinthians 6:11), Christ as our advocate (1 John 2:1), and every wonderful things included in Christ (Romans 8:32).
