<em><sup>10</sup>When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. <sup>11</sup>He said to them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those outside, everything is in parables, <sup>12</sup>so that although they look they may look but not see, and although they hear they may hear but not understand, so they may not repent and be forgiven (Mark 4:10-12)."</em>
